# EVM-project
electronic voting machine
 Embedded Systems project which is designing an electronic voting machine ( EVM ) using atmega32 micro controller.

The basic idea behind an EVM is to provide a secure and efficient means of conducting elections. EVM is a specialized electronic device used to record and count votes in place of traditional paper ballots.

I suppose that there are 4 candidates
A, B, C and D. Each candidate has a button. I added a button E that makes you enable to reset the counters of the candidates. The votes are displayed on a LCD.

- Hardware components:-
1- LCD 
2-5Buttons

The software program design consists of 3 layers:-
1- MCAL layer: GPIO 
2- HAL layer: LCD and Button module 
3- Application layer: the application unit.
